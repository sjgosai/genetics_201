## HMS Genetics-201 Fall 2016

This repository will contain the notes and knickknacks I generate while I am TAing Genetics 201 as well as any thoughtful contributions that anyone (regardless of if you are taking the class) would be generous enough to provide. While I will do my best to provide thorough (and accurate!) notes, I would be remiss not to point you to [Eric Minikel's blog](http://www.cureffi.org/) where he has posted extremely well written [notes for this class](http://www.cureffi.org/tag/genetics-201/) among other [fantastic pieces](http://www.cureffi.org/2016/01/20/does-this-mean-ill-definitely-get-the-disease/). Instead, I aim for this platform to provide a dynamic and interactive learning experience that will foster discussion and collaboration throughout the semester. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

__A Warning__: I would like to echo the point Max made about attending lecture. There truly is no substitute for attending lectures and nobody's notes will perfectly reflect what was taught in class. Moreover content is updated from year to year to reflect recent advancements in technology and understanding.

### Code

Rigorous quantitative analysis is an important part of Biological research and many tools exist to facilitate this. One such tool is [R, a programming language for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/), which we will be using later in the semester to analyze human genetics data. R is free and provides the foundation for a large number of [bioinformatics tools](https://www.bioconductor.org/). I will post R code where it is relevant to the class, so I encourage you to download it early. I also recommend installing [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), an excellent user interface used on top of the base environment (both R and Rstudio must be installed), as well as [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/), an interactive way to learn R that is suitable for absolute beginners.
