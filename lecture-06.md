### Extragenic Suppressors
|type of supressor|type of mutant|
|---|---|
|informational|nonsense|
|bypass|deletion|
|epistatic|deletion or missense|
|interaction|missense|

<br>
__Informational Suppressors__
(nonsense suppressors)

nonsense mutations : sense condon -> nonsense codon

|DNA|RNA|designation|
|---|---|---|
|TAG|UAG|amber|
|TAA|UAA|ochre|
|TGA|UGA|opal|

A nonsense suppressor is a mutation in a tRNA gene such that it reads nonsense as sense

<br>
__Bypass suppressor__<br>
_E. coli_ malEdel - maltose permease -> selected Mal<sup>+</sup> -> mutations in lacY - lactose permease

<br>
__Suppression by Epistasis__
Need to draw a figure

|strain|mate?|
|---|---|
|wt|+|
|ste7|-|
|ste11|-|
|ste20|-|
|STE11-4|+|
|STE11-4;ste20|+|
|STE11-4;ste7|-|

STE11-4 is epistatic to ste20<br>
ste7 is epistatic to STE11-4

<br>
__Interaction Suppressors__<br>
A defect in one protein is restored by a compensating change in an interacting protein

1. lock and key

|gtype|ptype|
|---|---|
|AB|wt|
|aB|mutant - interacting proteins don't fit together anymore|
|ab|wt - compensitory mutation in b allows fit with mutated a|

2. increased affinity

|gtype|ptype|
|---|---|
|AB|wt|
|aB|mutant - some points of interaction between a and B have been broken|
|ab|wt - mutant b has greater binding affinity for a, nonspecifically|
